# NOTICE
less updates since school will start soon

# What is this?
I had been building worlds for a couple of months before deciding to make this. Mangar, which is a city in one of my worlds, was the original namesake of my web editor, before i changed the name to the turkish word for Draft
(Taslak) i liked this name because i felt connected to it.


Anyways, I had started to watch some of CaryKH's videos, and especially his evolution simulator. I decided i would make something similar but with worldbuilding!
SWC is a program made for completley simulating fantasy worlds: cultures, states, climate, and cities all being generated using complex algorithms


# Current Version:
the current version  that has been released is 0.1.2. I try to advance the counter by 2 every week, so the next update would be 0.2.0. Heres how to read
the number: 
the first number is the number of full parts have been completed, the second number is how many sections of that part has been completed, and the last number is the number of tasks in the current section that have been completed:

| number | meaning|
|----------|:---------:|
|1| the number of full parts have been completed|
|2| how many sections of that part has been completed|
|3|the number of tasks in the current section that have been completed|
